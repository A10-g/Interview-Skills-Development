# The Walrus Operator in Python
The Walrus Operator is a new addition to Python 3.8 and allows you to assign a value to a variable within an expression. This can be useful when you need to use a value multiple times in a loop, but don't want to repeat the calculation.

The Walrus Operator is represented by the `:=` syntax and can be used in a variety of contexts including while loops and if statements.

Here's an example of how you can use the Walrus Operator in a while loop:
```python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

while (n := len(numbers)) > 0:
    print(numbers.pop())
```
In this example, the length of the `numbers` list is assigned to the variable n using the Walrus Operator. The value of `n` is then used in the condition of the while loop, so that the loop will continue to execute until the `numbers` list is empty.

Another example of using the Walrus Operator in an if statement:
```python
names = ["John", "Jane", "Jim"]

if (name := input("Enter a name: ")) in names:
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
else:
    print("Name not found.")
```
