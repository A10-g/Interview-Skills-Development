# Why do we use CSS?
We use CSS because of the following reasons:

CSS saves time: You can write CSS once and reuse the same sheet on multiple HTML pages.
Easy Maintenance: To make a global change simply change the style, and all elements in all the webpages will be updated automatically.
Search Engines: CSS is considered a clean coding technique, which means search engines won’t have to struggle to “read” its content.
Superior styles to HTML: CSS has a much wider array of attributes than HTML, so you can give a far better look to your HTML page in comparison to HTML attributes.
Offline Browsing: CSS can store web applications locally with the help of an offline cache. Using of this we can view offline websites.
