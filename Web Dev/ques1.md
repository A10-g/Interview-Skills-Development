# What is Hydration in web development


In web development, hydration refers to the process of taking an HTML document that has been rendered on the server-side and adding interactivity to it on the client-side using JavaScript.

When a user requests a page from a web server, the server generates an HTML document and sends it back to the user's web browser. This initial HTML document contains the content and structure of the web page, but it may lack interactivity.
