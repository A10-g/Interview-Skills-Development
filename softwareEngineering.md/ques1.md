##What are bitmap images?



Bitmap images, also known as raster images, are digital images composed of pixels, which are small dots of color. Each pixel in a bitmap image is assigned a specific color value, which together create the overall image. Bitmap images are resolution-dependent, meaning that the quality of the image is determined by the number of pixels in the image, or its resolution.

Bitmap images are commonly used for photographs and other complex images, such as drawings or paintings. 

Examples of bitmap image file formats include JPEG, BMP, and PNG.
