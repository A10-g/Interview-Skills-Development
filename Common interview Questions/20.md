### 20.Tell me about a time you had to persuade someone.
Ref. reply: I had to persuade a professor to provide additional resources for a group project. I prepared a well-researched proposal, highlighting the potential benefits of the resources, and presented it to the professor. Eventually, the professor agreed to our request, and it positively impacted our project.
