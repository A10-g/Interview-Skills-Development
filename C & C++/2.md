# Go to statement in C?

 In C programming, "goto" is a keyword used for unconditional branching to a labeled statement in the same function. It allows you to jump to a specific labeled statement in the code without executing the statements in between. Here is an example:
 
           #include <stdio.h>

                      int main() {
                int i = 0;
   
                loop:
                printf("i = %d\n", i);
                i++;
                if (i < 5) {
                    goto loop; // unconditional jump to label "loop"
                }

                 return 0;
              }
