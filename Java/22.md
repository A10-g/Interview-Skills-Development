# Describe synchronization with respect to multithreading?
Ans. With respect to multithreading, synchronization is the capability to control the access of multiple threads to shared resources. Without synchronization, it is possible for one thread to modify a shared variable while another thread is in the process of using or updating the same shared variable. This usually leads to significant errors.
