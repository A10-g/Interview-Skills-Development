# Explain thread synchronization and how u can achieve the Thread Synchronization in Java.

Thread synchronization is a mechanism that ensures that only one thread can access a shared resource at a time. This is important in multithreaded applications, where multiple threads may be trying to access the same data or resources. Without synchronization, it is possible for data corruption or other errors to occur.

There are two main ways to achieve thread synchronization in Java:

Synchronized methods: A synchronized method is a method that can only be executed by one thread at a time. This is achieved by locking the object on which the method is called before the method is executed. The lock is released when the method finishes executing.
Synchronized blocks:A synchronized block is a block of code that can only be executed by one thread at a time. This is achieved by locking the object on which the block is located before the block is executed. The lock is released when the block finishes executing.

Here is an example of a synchronized method:

public synchronized void myMethod() {
  // Do something that needs to be synchronized
}

Here is an example of a synchronized block:

synchronized (this) {
  // Do something that needs to be synchronized
}
