# What is the difference between an interpreter and a compiler?


An interpreter translates and executes code line by line, immediately executing each instruction as it is encountered. This means that errors can be identified quickly, as the interpreter stops executing the code as soon as an error is encountered. Interpreted languages include Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.

On the other hand, a compiler translates the entire source code into machine language before it is executed. The resulting compiled program can be executed multiple times without the need for re-translation, making it generally faster than interpreted programs. Compiled languages include C, C++, Java, and Swift.
