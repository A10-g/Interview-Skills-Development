## What is DBMS and what is its utility?Explain RDBMS with examples.

DBMS stands for Database Management System. It is a software system that helps to manage, store, and retrieve data from a database. The primary utility of DBMS is to provide an efficient and effective way of managing large volumes of data. It enables users to access and manipulate data stored in a database, by providing a set of tools and interfaces.

DBMS offers a number of benefits, including:

1.Data organization: DBMS helps in organizing the data in a structured way, by creating tables, columns, and rows. This makes it easier to store, manage, and retrieve data.

2.Data sharing: DBMS allows multiple users to access and modify the same data simultaneously, without any conflicts.

3.Data security: DBMS provides security features to protect the data from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

4.Data integrity: DBMS maintains data integrity by enforcing constraints and rules, which ensures that the data is consistent and accurate.

5.Data backup and recovery: DBMS provides features to backup and recover data, in case of system failures or disasters.



RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System. It is a type of DBMS that stores data in the form
of tables or relations. It uses a set of rules or constraints called "integrity constraints" to maintain the relationships 
between the tables. RDBMS is the most commonly used type of DBMS because it is easy to use and can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

Here are some examples of RDBMS:
 MySQL,Oracle,Microsoft SQL,PostgreSQL
