Vertical scaling (also known as scaling up) is the process of adding more resources to a single machine. This can include adding more CPU cores, memory, storage, or network bandwidth. Vertical scaling is typically the simplest and least expensive way to scale a system, but it is also the least scalable. There is a physical limit to how much hardware can be added to a single machine, and beyond that point, vertical scaling will not be able to keep up with demand.

Horizontal scaling (also known as scaling out) is the process of adding more machines to a system. This can be done by adding more servers to a cluster, or by using a cloud computing platform to dynamically add and remove servers as needed. Horizontal scaling is more expensive than vertical scaling, but it is also more scalable. There is no theoretical limit to how many machines can be added to a horizontally scaled system.
