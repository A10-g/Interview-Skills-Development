### Explain different languages present in DBMS.

There are several types of languages that are used for different purposes:


Data Definition Language (DDL): DDL is used to define the structure of the database. It includes commands like CREATE, ALTER, and DROP, which are used to create, modify, and delete tables, indexes, and other database objects.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): DML is used to manipulate the data in the database. It includes commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, which are used to retrieve, insert, modify, and delete data in tables.

Query Language (QL): QL is used to retrieve data from the database. SQL (Structured Query Language) is the most popular query language used in DBMS, but there are other query languages like XQuery and SPARQL used for specific purposes.

Procedural Language (PL): PL is used to write procedures and functions that can be executed in the database. PL/SQL, Transact-SQL, and PL/pgSQL are some examples of procedural languages used in DBMS.
