## Difference between Vertical and Horizontal scaling?



* **Vertical scaling** (also known as **scaling up**) involves adding more resources to an existing machine. This can be done by adding more CPU, RAM, storage, or network bandwidth. Vertical scaling is a good option for applications that need more processing power or memory. However, it can be expensive to upgrade existing machines, and there is a limit to how much you can scale a single machine.
* **Horizontal scaling** (also known as **scaling out**) involves adding more machines to a system. This can be done by adding more servers, virtual machines, or containers. Horizontal scaling is a good option for applications that need to handle more traffic or workload. It is also more scalable than vertical scaling, as there is no limit to how many machines you can add. However, horizontal scaling can be more complex to implement and manage.



| Feature | Vertical scaling | Horizontal scaling |
|---|---|---|
| How it works | Add more resources to an existing machine | Add more machines to a system |
| Pros | Simple to implement, less complex to manage | Scalable, can handle more traffic or workload |
| Cons | Expensive to upgrade existing machines, limited scalability | Complex to implement, more difficult to manage |
| Best for | Applications that need more processing power or memory | Applications that need to handle more traffic or workload |
| Time | It takes less time to be done  |It takes more time to be done|
