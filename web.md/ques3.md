#  Describe the different kinds of HTTP requests supported by RESTful Web services.

Each HTTP request type in RESTful web services has a specific purpose. Below is a description of them:

- **GET**: It is used to retrieve data or resources from the server but only allows read-only access. You cannot modify it.
- **POST**: It is used for creating a new resource.
- **PUT**: This is similar to POST, but used for updating an existing resource (if the resource doesn't exist, the API will decide whether a new resource should be created).
- **DELETE**: It is used to delete the resource from the server.
- **TRACE**: It validates the content along with the network during an HTTP request.
