# What is an integer array?

  An integer array is a data structure that stores a collection of integers (whole numbers) in a contiguous block of memory. It is a type of array that can hold a fixed number of elements, where each element is an integer.
  
   ## For example, an integer array of size 5 may be declared as:
              
              
     int arr[5];
