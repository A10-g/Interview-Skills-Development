# What is the use of "const" keyword in C programming?

  In C programming, the "const" keyword is used to declare a variable or a pointer as read-only, meaning that its value cannot be modified after it has been initialized. This allows for greater program reliability, as it prevents accidental modification of variables that should not be changed.
  
   For Example:
      
      
        const int MAX_VALUE = 100;
