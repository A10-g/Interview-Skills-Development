What are references in C++?
When a variable is described as a reference it becomes an alias of the already existing variable. 
In simple terms, a referenced variable is another named variable of an existing variable keeping in mind that changes made in the reference variable will be reflected in the already existing variable. 
A reference variable is preceded with a ‘&’ symbol.

Syntax:
int GFG = 10;
// reference variable
int& ref = GFG;
