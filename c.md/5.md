# What is the difference between "strcmp" and "strncmp" functions in C programming?

 
  In C programming, strcmp() and strncmp() are string comparison functions that are used to compare two strings. The main difference between them is the number of characters      that are compared.

   strcmp() compares two strings until it finds a null character (\0) or until the two strings differ. It returns an integer value indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:

    If the two strings are equal, it returns 0.
    If the first string is greater than the second string, it returns a positive value.
    If the first string is less than the second string, it returns a negative value.
    
    
  On the other hand, strncmp() compares a specified number of characters from the beginning of two strings. It takes three arguments: the two strings to be compared, and the maximum number of characters to be compared. It returns an integer value indicating the result of the comparison, as follows:

    If the first n characters of the two strings are equal, it returns 0.
    If the first n characters of the first string are greater than the first n characters of the second string, it returns a positive value.
    If the first n characters of the first string are less than the first n characters of the second string, it returns a negative value.
