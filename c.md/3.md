# What is the difference between "++i" and "i++" in C programming?


   In C programming, "++i" and "i++" are both increment operators, but they behave differently.

   "++i" is called the pre-increment operator. It increments the value of "i" by 1 before using it in the expression. For example, if "i" is initially 5, the expression "++i +     2" would result in 8 because "i" is first incremented to 6, and then added to 2.

   On the other hand, "i++" is called the post-increment operator. It increments the value of "i" by 1 after using it in the expression. For example, if "i" is initially 5,      the expression "i++ + 2" would also result in 7, because "i" is first used in the expression (which evaluates to 5 + 2), and then incremented to 6.

   So, the main difference between the two is the order in which the increment operation occurs in the expression. "++i" increments before the expression is evaluated, while       "i++" increments after the expression is evaluated.
