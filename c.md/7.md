# What is an STL in C++?


STL stands for Standard Template Library, which is a powerful set of C++ template classes and functions. It is a library that provides a collection of container classes, algorithms, and iterators, which are implemented as templates.

STL provides a variety of useful data structures such as vectors, lists, sets, and maps, along with algorithms to manipulate these containers. With STL, developers can write efficient and reliable code that is both easy to read and maintain.

Some of the advantages of using STL in C++ include:

1.Code Reusability: With STL, developers can reuse code and avoid writing repetitive code. This makes development faster and more efficient.

2.Improved Productivity: STL provides a set of powerful tools that enable developers to write efficient and reliable code quickly.

3.Standardization: Since STL is a part of the C++ standard library, it ensures portability and compatibility across different platforms.
