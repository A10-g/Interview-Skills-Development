### What is a MAC address, and how is it different from an IP address?

A MAC (Media Access Control) address is a unique hardware address assigned to network interface cards. It is used at the data link layer to identify devices within the same local network. An IP address, on the other hand, is used for network routing and operates at the network layer, allowing devices to communicate across different networks.
