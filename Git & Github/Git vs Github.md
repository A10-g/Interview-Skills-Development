# Whatâ€™s the difference between Git and GitHub?

Git is a version control system that helps developers to manage changes to their codebase. It is a command-line tool that allows you to track changes, create branches, and merge changes between them. Git stores all the changes in a repository, which can be hosted locally on your computer or remotely on a server.

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides a graphical interface and tools that allow developers to collaborate on projects hosted on the platform. GitHub offers features such as issue tracking, pull requests, and code review tools that enable teams to work together on software projects.
