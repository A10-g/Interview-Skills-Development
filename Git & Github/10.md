# What is the difference between ‘git remote’ and ‘git clone’?

The difference between "git remote" and "git clone" is as follows:

1. "git remote": This command is used to add or manage references to remote repositories in your local Git repository. It allows you to establish a connection between your local repository and a remote repository, enabling you to fetch and push changes to and from the remote repository. "git remote" is primarily used for setting up and managing remote repository references.

2. "git clone": This command is used to create a local copy of an existing remote repository. When you clone a repository, you download the entire repository's history, files, and branches onto your local machine. This allows you to have your own local copy of the project to work with and make changes to. "git clone" is typically used when you want to start working with a project that is hosted in a remote repository.

In summary, "git remote" is used for managing remote repository references, while "git clone" is used to create a local copy of a remote repository.
