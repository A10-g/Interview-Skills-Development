# What is git conflict?

A git conflict is an error that occurs when two or more users make changes to the same file in a Git repository. Git will not be able to automatically merge the changes, and the user will need to resolve the conflict manually.

There are two types of git conflicts:

* Content conflict: This occurs when two users make changes to the same lines of code in a file.
* Rename conflict: This occurs when two users rename the same file.

To resolve a git conflict, the user must open the file and manually merge the changes. The user can use the following steps to resolve a content conflict:

1. Locate the conflicting lines of code.
2. Decide which changes to keep.
3. Delete the conflict markers.
4. Add the changes to the index.
5. Commit the changes.

To resolve a rename conflict, the user must open the file and manually rename it. The user can use the following steps to resolve a rename conflict:

1. Locate the conflicting file.
2. Decide which name to keep.
3. Delete the conflict markers.
4. Rename the file.
5. Add the changes to the index.
6. Commit the changes.

Here are some tips for avoiding git conflicts:

* Use a version control system like Git to track your changes.
* Make sure you are working on the latest version of the file.
* Use a merge tool to help you resolve conflicts.
* Communicate with your team members about your changes.
