# What is forking in Git?

Forking in Git refers to creating a copy of a repository. When you fork a repository, you create a separate copy of the project under your account. Forking allows you to freely experiment with changes and modifications without affecting the original project. It is commonly used for proposing changes or contributions to someone else's project. Forked repositories can be kept independent or later merged back into the original repository if desired.
