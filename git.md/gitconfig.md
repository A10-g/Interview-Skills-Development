# What does the command git config do?

git config is a powerful command in Git. You can use the Git configuration file to customize how Git works.

This file exists in the project level where Git is initialized (/project/.git/config) or at the root level (~/.gitconfig). If no configurations are specified, Git uses its default settings.
