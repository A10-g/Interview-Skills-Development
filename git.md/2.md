# What do you understand by the term ‘Version Control System’?


A Version Control System (VCS) is a software tool that helps manage changes to a collection of files over time. It is commonly used in software development to track revisions to source code files, but it can also be applied to any type of file or document.

The main purpose of a VCS is to enable collaboration among multiple developers working on the same project by keeping track of all modifications made to the files. It provides mechanisms to track changes, merge different versions, and revert to previous states if needed. This allows developers to work concurrently on different features or bug fixes without overwriting each other's changes.

Version control systems typically store a history of changes, allowing users to view the entire evolution of a file or project. They provide features such as branching and merging, which enable the creation of separate lines of development and the integration of changes from different branches back into the main codebase. This branching and merging capability facilitates parallel development, experimentation, and the management of complex software projects.

Common version control systems include Git, Subversion (SVN), Mercurial, and Perforce. These systems provide both centralized and distributed models, offering various workflows and features to accommodate different project requirements.

In summary, a Version Control System is a tool that tracks changes to files over time, facilitates collaboration among developers, and allows for the management and organization of software projects.
