# What is Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)?

Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is one of the main protocols in the Internet Protocol (IP) suite. It's used to establish and maintain a connection between devices on a network. Here are some key aspects of TCP:

- **Connection-Oriented Protocol:** TCP is connection-oriented, meaning it establishes a connection before data is transmitted and ensures that data is reliably delivered to the destination.

- **Reliability:** It guarantees that data sent from one device will be received by the other in the correct order and without errors. If data packets are lost or corrupted during transmission, TCP retransmits them.

- **Flow Control:** TCP manages the rate at which data is sent to prevent overwhelming the recipient. It uses a sliding window mechanism to control the flow of data.

- **Error Detection and Correction:** TCP uses checksums to detect errors in transmitted data. If an error is detected, TCP will request retransmission of the affected data.

- **Full-Duplex Communication:** TCP allows data to be sent in both directions simultaneously, meaning devices can both send and receive data at the same time.

- **Acknowledgments (ACKs):** After receiving a packet of data, the recipient sends an acknowledgment (ACK) back to the sender to confirm that the data was received successfully.

- **Port Numbers:** TCP uses port numbers to identify specific services or applications on a device. The combination of an IP address and a port number directs data to the correct application.

- **Connection Termination:** When the communication is complete, TCP ensures that the connection is closed properly.

- **Flow Control and Congestion Control:** TCP employs algorithms to prevent network congestion, which can occur when too much data is sent too quickly.
